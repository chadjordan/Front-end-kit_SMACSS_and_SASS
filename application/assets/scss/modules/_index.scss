// Module Rules

/*******************************************************************

	This is the meat of the page. Modules sit inside Layout components.
	Modules can sometimes sit within other Modules, too.
	Each Module should be designed to exist as a standalone component.
	In doing so, the page will be more flexible.
	If done right, Modules can easily be moved to different parts of the layout without breaking.

	Example of this are the buttons, nav, dialogs, carousels, and so on.
