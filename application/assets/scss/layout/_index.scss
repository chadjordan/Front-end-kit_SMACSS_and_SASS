// Layout Rules


/*******************************************************************

	Layout styles can also be divided into major and minor styles based on
	reuse. Major layout styles such as header and footer are traditionally
	styled but take the time to think about the elements
	that are common across all components of the page and use class selectors
	where appropriate.

	such as grids, pages-layout, aside, footer, header and etc.
